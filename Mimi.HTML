<p style="color: brown;" >Eating good food, especially with family and friends, is one of the pleasures of life.We all know that people who eat healthy, balanced diets are likely to have:

    plenty of energy to work and enjoy themselves;
    
    fewer infections and other illnesses.
    
    Children who eat well usually grow well.Women who eat well are likely to produce healthy babies. That is why it is important to know which combinations of foods make good meals and what the different food needs of different members of the family are.</p> <hr><br>
